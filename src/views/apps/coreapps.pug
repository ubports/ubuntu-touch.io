      | Ubuntu Touch comes pre-installed with a set of solid core apps that cover your daily needs. This includes everything you expect from a phone, like a dialer, contacts and calendar, but since it's Ubuntu, the OS comes with a fully-featured file browser and terminal (including essential command-line applications) as well.
