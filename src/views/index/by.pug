      | The UBports Project is financed by many generous donations via #[a(href='https://paypal.me/ubports', target='_blank') PayPal], #[a(href='https://patreon.com/ubports', target='_blank') Patreon] and #[a(href='https://ubports.com/sponsors', target='_blank') Bitcoin], as well as #[a(href='https://ubports.com/sponsors', target='_blank') these awesome sponsors]. This funding has allowed us to keep the lights on and hire developers for some of the work, but we would not be anywhere without our great #[a(href='https://ubports.com/get-involved', target='_blank') community contributors].

      | Tasks like #[a(href='https://translate.ubports.com', target='_blank') localization], #[a(href='https://github.com/ubports/ubuntu-touch/issues', target='_blank') quality assurance] and even #[a(href='https://github.com/ubports', target='_blank') development] are handled to a surprising extent by volunteers.
